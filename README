Headwater

1. Run specs
rspec spec

2. Take a look at lib
lib/service
lib/synchronizer

3. Exciting stuff. Someone will have to try this, but
I think all you have to do is setup API key in environment.rb
and do "rake sync". 

It will pull stuff from Pivotal Tracker and you're good to
"rails s" and play!
