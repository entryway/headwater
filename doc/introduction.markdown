# Introducing Headwater

There are many web development companies these days. All of them have many problems with the process. We are no exception. 

We try to find solutions, and if we don't succeed we create our own solutions. And make it awesome.

First, let me tell you about our problems and the solutions we use.

## Problems & Solutions

1. Project management

We use tool called [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com). It's free and it's much better than many paid solutions. We like it a lot, but ...

2. Time tracking

We use [Harvest](http://harvestapp.com) the time tracker. It has really cool reporting features.

3. Source code management

[GitHub](http://github.com), of course.

## Integration

Now all these tools are great, but wouldn't it be cool if they were a little bit more integrated? Like into one tool?

And that's when Headwater comes.

It's a web application that takes your data from Pivotal Tracker, display just whatever you need to be focused on, and lets you track the time. Everything works nicely and stays synchronized with the remote services.

For Git it generates cool commit messages with Pivotal Tracker story IDs. 

## Get it!

Headwater is open-source and you can grab a clone from our [GitHub repository](http://github.com/entryway/headwater). 

It's still in alpha/beta/something-like-that-phase. You're welcome to report issues, fork, hack, commit and help us make it awesome.
